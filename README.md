# Study Buddy by Hadi Shaheryar and Ibrahim Parvez

Welcome to **Study Buddy**. We were inspired to make this application because of the struggle that comes along with planning study sessions and finding the right method to study. Oftentimes, students coming into university find it difficult to match their schedules with study groups, whether that be because of extracurriculars, jobs, commuting, etc. Study Buddy provides an alternative where you can personalize your study sessions while still reaping the benefits that you would usually get in a group study session.
